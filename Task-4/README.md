# Task 4: Adding Tasks

## Description

For this task, we'll be creating a class to manage the tasks, adding a method to the class to keep track of tasks in our application, and connecting up the New Task form to create tasks.

## Step 1: The Setup 

In this step, we'll re-organize our folder structure in preparation for the next few steps.

1. Create a js folder in your project if one does not already exist
2. Copy the existing `js` file into your js folder, and rename it to `index.js`
3. Update the `<script>` tag in your html file to use the new location of the `js/index.js` file.
4. Create a `taskManager.js` file in the `js` folder
5. Add a `<script>` tag pointing to the `js/taskManager.js` file before the `<script>` tag pointing to the `js/index.js` file.

## Step 2: The TaskManager Class

## Step 3: Adding A New Task Programmatically
